# Final Project
This is an application that uses an external library, OpenCV, in order to detect a face, detect the region of the eyes, and detect the pupil in the region of the eyes.

##In Partial Fulfillment of the laboratory requirements
Software Implementation of the App (to be published in Google Play)
This will be updated when the link for the application is available

## Reference / Source / Basis
This project was based on an open-sourced code by Roman Hošek in 2013. The url for where the code was obtained is found in the link below:
http://romanhosek.cz/android-eye-detection-updated-for-opencv-2-4-6/

The developer of this application would like to thank Roman Hošek for sharing the source code online. The source codes on this repository were modified to include other features than just quickly jumping in into the application itself and some of these other features may be found in the screenshots below.

4. Eye Detection on Multiple Faces
This is very inaccurate since the training method works best when done on only one face
